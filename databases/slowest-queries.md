# Slowest Queries

## [Krzysztof Grzybek](https://github.com/krzysztof-grzybek)

I worked mainly with mySql database. It provides a tool for monitoring slow queries. All You have to do is enabling logging slow queries into the specified file. You can also specify the minimum time threshold.
Additionally, if app is deployed to the cloud, probably there is an option to setup an email notifications which will notify you if those queries were executed.
