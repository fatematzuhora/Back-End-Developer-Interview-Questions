# Goto is Evil

## [Krzysztof Grzybek](https://github.com/krzysztof-grzybek)

I wouldn't be so radical in either direction. I think that structured programming won the debate because it's the right thing to do. It's easier to reason about a program written in this manner.<br/>
On the other hand, even writing this kind of programs we often use the `goto` like style (early returns, exception handling) and it doesn't do any harm.<br/>
In my opinion the same applies to the `goto` statements - function-scoped `goto` statements here and there might really make our program simpler and easier to understand.<br/>
