# Dependency Hell

## [Krzysztof Grzybek](https://github.com/krzysztof-grzybek)

1. The most basic approach is to manually update dependencies to satisfy other package versioning or to ask the maintainer to do this.
2. If I trust the semantic versioning libraries I use, I try to do more relaxed versioning.
2. A better solution for this problem is to keep projects in monorepo. This approach implies other challenges though.
3. Another interesting solution is a [system for easier dependencies management](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VNqmHJtItCs) introduced by Netflix Engineering.
